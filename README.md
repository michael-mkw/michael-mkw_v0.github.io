# GIS Analyst  |  Surveyor

## Background

A graduate of the Master of Geographic Information Systems at the University of Calgary in December 2023, with a bachelor's degree in geomatics and experience in the geomatics industry. Passionate for learning and enhancing skills and knowledge in GIS, and keen on exploring topics in the geography field. 

### My Story

My first journey with GIS started during my time as a geomatics undergraduate student - I joined the volunteering community service projects organized by the University to remote hamlets in Jogjakarta, Indonesia and collaborated with the villagers in identifying local socio-economic issues, conducting geospatial analysis and presenting data cartographically. 

Later when I was working as a surveyor in the geomatics industry, I was always fascinated by the powerful GIS tools and their potential to facilitate data management in the workplace. With a mindset of understanding the potential of GIS, I enrolled in the GIS graduate program in 2022. Empowered by my mixed academic background, I seek to work on domains including environmental conservation, resource management, and sustainability in society through GIS.
